Algorithms_for_beginners

This repository is for individuals with little to no experience with algorithm or model selection for machine learning projects. If you are experienced, you will prefer other repos. This repo is strictly for problem-solving individuals who are not interested in the time and consideration of machine learning, which is okay. 

There are several steps to begin your machine learning project. This is a brief overview of the steps needed to achieve success:
  1. Data acquisition and formatting
  2. Model selection
  3. Hyperparameter selection
  4. Output analysis

Each step will be labeled with a file, for instance "model_selection.py" and "model_selection.md" that will correspond to the stage. The ".py" files are python code for copying and pasting; the ".md" files are instruction manuals and helpful information regarding the code. 

If you are truly just trying to make a model and solve a problem, rather than understanding the code, you likely will not need the ".md" files associated with the steps of model building. The code has enough comments and is readable enough to truly just plug and chug.
